# Sample wasm project

To run this project, do the following

```
npm install
npm run compile  // if you have emcc activated in your system
npm run serve
```

Note: added build folder which has wasm here. Just to make sure that you can run
this even when you don't have emcc to compile rust. :)

Happy Hacking :)
